## Welcome to My kbeznak parmatonic page

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/PuneetKohli/kbeznak-parmatonic/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

This page is hosted on GitHub Pages and run using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### What is a kbeznak parmatonic?

Good question! The answer is : I have no idea! This is most probably a fictional word created by [Dr. James Caverlee](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/) aka Cav for the [Information Storage and Retrieval (ISR)](http://courses.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/csce670/) Homework 2. The homework is essentially a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) contest for the keywords 'kbeznak parmatonic' which don't link to anything on Google, except a Hebrew (?) Wikipedia page of Kobe Bryant. https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/PuneetKohli/kbeznak-parmatonic/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
