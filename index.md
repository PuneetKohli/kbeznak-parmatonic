### What is a kbeznak parmatonic?

Good question! The answer is : I have no idea! This is most probably a fictional word created by [Dr. James Caverlee](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/) aka Cav for the [Information Storage and Retrieval (ISR)](http://courses.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/csce670/) Homework 2. The homework is essentially a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) contest for the keywords 'kbeznak parmatonic' which don't link to anything on Google, except a Hebrew (?) Wikipedia page of Kobe Bryant. https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant
